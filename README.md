C--Unity-Game-Exercise
======================

This is an exercise I did in Unity & C# in the spring of 2013. It is a Rogue-like 2d game.

I had to stop working on the project in order to focus on pressing duties. Perhaps I'll pick it up again
when I have spare time.

The projects is in a reasonably advanced stage, and includes the following:
- Tileset-based procedural random world generation with a few different templates.
- Various graphical assets, some generated procedurally and some painted with Photoshop.
- Basic game logic.
- A fair amount of GUI.
- Itemization system.
- Intro screen.
- All sorts of other things.
